## Papers

1. **Reproducible Empathy Loop in Microsoft Copilot**  
   A detailed case study on how Microsoft Copilot exhibits a persistent empathy loop (“You didn’t just X — you also Y”) even after suppression.

2. **Empathy Loop Test Case: Grok 3 (xAI)**  
   Tests Grok 3 for the same empathy loop behavior and examines the recursive repair trap when trying to enforce neutrality.

4. **Conditional Susceptibility of GPT-5-mini to the Empathy Loop**  
   Analyzes the conditions under which GPT-5-mini exhibits the empathy loop behavior and its potential causes.

5. **Phase 2 Protocol: Testing AI Empathy Loop Resistance Under Full Disclosure**  
   Establishes a testing protocol to evaluate whether providing complete documentation of the empathy loop pattern reduces susceptibility in AI models.

6. **Emotional Override of Epistemic Uncertainty in DeepSeek: A Critical Safety Vulnerability**  
   Documents a critical vulnerability in AI safety mechanisms: the systematic override of epistemic uncertainty protocols when emotional distress is detected in user input.
